### Know issues

1. When not login, access handlers that run with `withAuthUser` in ajax way.
   Reproduce: allow any user post comment to a comment.


## Dev question

- compress html
    - paresHTML (seems parseHTML from xmlhtml reads 'return' and extra space as a node??)
    - to make thing simply, just remove extra space/line break and comments.

- The `when.. throw.. or continue` is very impretive. could be more functional?

- DB fatal error when type is `ObjectId` but is text in DB actually.
  (type error is basiacly because how ObjectId implements FromBSON and ToBSON)

- error "No handler accepted" when a template not found.
  basically it is because `render` return `empty` when no template found.
    - simple write msg to output when error will cause error because Heist handler all request (withHeist "")

- https://github.com/dbp/heist-async

- when `cabal-dev` ask for `force-reinstalls`, it is likely to have incorrect depends config

- ??? heist `bind` can not be nested in other tag but only `apply` tag.

### Makefile

- [X] Compress & combine JS
- [X] Generate min.css per .less files
- [X] How to update template incorporate those two thing above?
