### Makefile

- [ ] Compress & combine JS
- [ ] Generate min.css per .less files
- [ ] How to update template incorporate those two thing above?

### Know issues

1. When not login, access handlers that run with `withAuthUser` in ajax way.
   Reproduce: allow any user post comment to a comment.


## Dev question

- compress html
    - paresHTML (seems parseHTML from xmlhtml reads 'return' and extra space as a node??)
    - to make thing simply, just remove extra space/line break and comments.

- The `when.. throw.. or continue` is very impretive. could be more functional?

- DB fatal error when type is `ObjectId` but is text in DB actually.
  (type error is basiacly because how ObjectId implements FromBSON and ToBSON)

- error "No handler accepted" when a template not found.
  basically it is because `render` return `empty` when no template found.
    - simple write msg to output when error will cause error because Heist handler all request (withHeist "")

## couple of notes
- [X] rm personal section from sidebar to settings.
      (page probably need to be re-design)
- [X] show "star person" at sidebar top
- [X] rm "score board" from sidebar.
- redesign write post / comment panel
    - [X] preview on the fly?
    - [ ] display tag right under input box.
- [ ] customize bootstrap css which is un-necessary large.
- [ ] allow user add tag?
- [ ] show person score like stackoverflow
- [ ] mv tags to sidebar.
- [ ] do not display click count.
